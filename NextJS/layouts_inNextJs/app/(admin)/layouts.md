# GROUPING Layouts:

```
It can be done by making all part-components of the single end-point (here /admin) under one folder and then adding the layout.js  for that point of search.
```

```
And the we can group all these layouts  by, changing the parent folder name as "(admin)"


NOTE: This step to be done under certain condition.
1.Server is not running.(ctrl+c to stop in terminal).
2. no files of the same directory should be in open mode.
3.then rename it as, admin->(admin)
```

```
Thus, we can surf to any url without using "/admin/xyz" point. we can directly visit the page and the grouped layout will be applied acroos all pages.
